					A rich man once sold a well to a poor farmer so that the farmer could use the well's water to irrigate his land. The rich man's price was accepted by the farmer. The farmer attempted to draw water from the well the following day, but the wealthy man stopped him and forbade him from doing so.<br><br>He claimed that the farmer had only purchased the well from him and not the water. As a result, he is unable to use the well's water. The farmer went to the king's court and informed Akbar about his propensity because he was unsure of what to do. Birbal received the case from Akbar.

						Birbal went to see the wealthy man who was troubling the farmer. Birbal responded, "Since you have sold the well and not the water to the farmer, you will have to move all the water or pay the farmer rent to keep the water in the well," in response to the rich man repeating what he had said to the farmer. <br> When the wealthy man realised his scheme would fail, he allowed the farmer to draw water from the well.
